Latest Builds
=============

These are the very latest builds built by [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Jadar/RankCapes). There is a build every time that a change is pushed to [GitHub]({{ site.github-project }}). For this reason, even though a build might have succeeded, there might still be a bad bug in it. I try not to push bad code but it happens every once and a while. Only builds that have succeeded are shown below.

**Bukkit Build Status**: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jadar/RankCapes.png?branch=bukkit-bleeding)](https://travis-ci.org/jadar/RankCapes)  
**Forge Build Status**: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jadar/RankCapes.png?branch=forge-bleeding)](https://travis-ci.org/jadar/RankCapes)
