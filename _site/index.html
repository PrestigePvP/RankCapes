<p>RankCapes was made for servers that would like to offer something more to their players. Originally dubbed “DonorCapes”, I made an experimental version that was rather sketchy and not very flexible. Now I have coded from the ground up this brand new plugin/mod combo that is a fun aesthetic mod that allows servers to give their players capes based on permissions given to them. RankCapes is not restricted to donating or contributing players, though; anyone can be given a cape, as anyone can be given a permission. Easy to use, RankCapes implements Cape Packs that are like Resource Packs and can be swapped back and forth easily.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Make you own capes for server players.</li>

<li>Multiple capes per player.</li>

<li>Animated and HD capes.</li>

<li>Movement-triggered Animated capes.</li>

<li>Cape Packs that are similar to Resource Packs for easy swapping.</li>

<li>Bukkit permission-based cape access system.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how_it_works">How it Works</h3>

<p>On the server there is a <a href="./wiki/Cape-Pack">Cape Pack</a> that contains all the textures as well as a file that associates images and cape names. Capes are given with this permission node: <code>rankcapes.cape.use.$CAPE_NAME</code>. When clients with the RankCapes mod installed connect to the server, they can change their cape to whatever they have permissions for in the cape change GUI. All other players with the mod installed can see theirs, and other player’s capes.</p>
